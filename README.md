### Here are the main technologies used in implementing todo list functionalities using Spring Boot and JSP:

#### Spring Boot:
Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications in Java. It provides a set of tools and conventions that simplify the development of web applications.

#### JavaServer Pages (JSP): 
JSP is a technology that allows the creation of dynamic web pages using Java code. It enables the creation of web pages that can interact with databases and other back-end systems.

#### Spring Data JPA: 
Spring Data JPA is a module of the Spring Framework that provides a set of abstractions for working with relational databases. It enables developers to perform database operations using simple and intuitive APIs.

#### MySQL: 
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is widely used in web applications for storing and retrieving data.

#### Spring Security: 
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable framework for securing Java web applications. It provides a set of features for authentication and authorization, including support for user registration, login, and password management.

#### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: 
HTML is used for creating the structure and content of web pages, while CSS is used for styling the pages. JavaScript is used for creating dynamic and interactive elements on the pages, such as dropdown menus and form validation.

Overall, Spring Boot and JSP provide a powerful and flexible platform for building todo list applications. They enable developers to create rich and responsive user interfaces, while also providing robust back-end functionality for managing and storing todo list items.
